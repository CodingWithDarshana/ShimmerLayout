Shimmer is an Android library that provides an easy way to add a shimmer effect to any view in your Android app. It is useful as an unobtrusive loading indicator that was originally developed for Facebook Home.

You might have noticed the shimmer effect in Facebookâ€™s mobile app while the data is loading from the network. Shimmer library is used to display an animation when data is loading to make the UI more interesting and attractive, instead of using the traditional ProgressBar. 

You can find the additional [documentation](http://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/) on the Shimmerâ€™s page.
